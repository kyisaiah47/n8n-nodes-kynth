// Kynth Core node for n8n — declarative (routing-based). The full operation

// GENERATED from the API's own endpoint catalog (apps/api scripts/
// generate-clients.ts), so the node can never drift from the live API.

	// `@n8n/community-nodes/icon-validation` reads the CLASS, not the description it
	// points at. The svg it names did not exist in the package at all until now, so the
	// node also shipped iconless. Both halves are fixed together.
